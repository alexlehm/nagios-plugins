check_end2end.pl is a plugin allowing automation of web navigation through the
definition of a list of steps to be performed.
It is based upon LWP::UserAgent and Monitoring::Plugin modules, available from
CPAN.

It checks overall status of the process, can check total and/or individual
duration of steps and search for strings/regexps inside response body.

Since version 1.5.0 check_end2end.pl can make requests through proxy and
supports basic http authentication.

License: Perl 5 license.

check_end2end.pl comes with a MANUAL PAGE.
TO SEE FULL DOCUMENTATION:
  - run
        perldoc check_end2end.pl
  - or run
        check_end2end.pl -M
    (the latter may not work if you don't have all the prerequisites installed).

All the steps to be performed are configured in a separate configuration file,
specified with the "-f" flag. The configuration file format is similar to the
one used by apache httpd:

<Step "StepName">
   url = http://...
   ...
</Step>

specify as many steps as you want, they will be performed in alphabetical order.
See the MAN PAGE for the full list of configuration parameters and the manual of
Config::General for the details of the format.
